This directory contains a minimal, custom distribution of TeX Live 2023 which is
shipped with the TexEdit project.

Binaries in this distribution should not be invoked directly. Instead, use the
'texcmp.sh' script or equivalent in the scripts/ directory, at the project root,
to compile TeX documents on the appropriate system architecture.

TexEdit is not affiliated with TeX Live.
