This directory contains an archive containing a lightweight TeX distribution largely based on TinyTeX:
    https://yihui.org/tinytex/

--------------------

Execute the `unpack.sh` script to extract it into the `build/` directory in the project root, in order to be distributed as-is.

When re-building the archive, use the following command while inside the distributable folder:
    tar -cvJf tex.tar.xz *

--------------------

The `tex.tar.xz` archive was last updated on 2024-06-12.
